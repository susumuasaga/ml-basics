As a `contrib` module, this is no longer available in TensorFlow 2.0, even in `tf.compat.v1`. Converting code using Slim to TF 2.0 is more involved than converting repositories that use `v1.layers`.

    "\n",
    "* Variables still all have a `name` argument you can set.\n",
    "* Keras models also take a `name` argument as which they set as the prefix for their variables.\n",
    "* The `v1.name_scope` function can be used to set variable name prefixes. This is very different from `tf.variable_scope`. It only affects names, and  doesn't track variables & reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that does not work for your use-case, try the `v1.train.init_from_checkpoint` function. It takes an `assignment_map` argument, which specifies the mapping from old names to new names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Unlike object based checkpoints, which can [defer loading](checkpoint.ipynb#loading_mechanics), name-based checkpoints require that all variables be built when the function is called. Some models defer building variables until you call `build` or run the model on a batch of data.\n",

    "The [TensorFlow Estimator repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/estimator/blob/master/tensorflow_estimator/python/estimator/tools/checkpoint_converter.py) includes a [conversion tool](#checkpoint_converter) to upgrade the checkpoints for premade estimators from TensorFlow 1.X to 2.0. It may serve as an example of how to build a tool for a similar use-case."

For `optimizer` args, if you do not pass in an `optimizer`, `dnn_optimizer` or `linear_optimizer` arg, or if you specify the `optimizer` arg as a `string` in your code, you don't need to change anything. `tf.keras.optimizers` is used by default.
